* Reaction-Diffusion Equation solution in both conventional and non-dimensional forms
* Full set of Continuum model parameters
* Normalized growth rate profile analysis
* 2 Interactive applications for more intuitive insight into the FEBID
* Secondary electron flux estimation from beam setup and exposed material
* A framework to run series of experiments with post-analysis and plotting
* A framework with a toolset for creating maps of parameter dependence 
* PSO optimization algorithm for finding optimal parameters
* Various plotting tools
* (Proto version of RDE solver on GPU)

## Installation
No installation needed. Just copy the repository to your local machine and check out Jupyter Notebooks in `tutorials`.

## Usage
1. Start with the `Introduction` notebook to get to know core simualtions capabilities.
2. Take a look at the `Applications` notebook and `apps` folder for some interactive applications.
